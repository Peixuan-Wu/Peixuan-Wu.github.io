##  future AI 142 | 220517

Electronic circuits function about a million times faster  than biochemical ones, so machine should think about a million times faster  than the minds that built it.

I find it is very much like "tech explosion" theory in science fiction. What matter isn't whether super AI would be invents but there's literally no time leave us to solve a series of problem caused by super AI once it comes. So a sorts of crisis awareness and actions should not be doubtde as far-fetched

## medical imaging | 220518

medical imaging can help us fight against cancer not blindly but more precisely

Actually, medical imaging is very important for treating tumor and I think it is a sort of application of computer vision. Every single tumor cell is fatal for human body. In the past, when doctor are removing the tumor part of our body piece by piece, they can only distinguish the normal and tumor by pressing the tissue by their thumb. However, with development of medical imaging, PET-CT technology can show doctor where the mass of tumor located. But the difficiency is clear as every single tumore cell can grow up and make bad effect on our body. Human need some medical imaging technology to show every single tumor cell location and doctor can precisely remove them.

## How to deal with rejection in life | 221116

Rejection always seems to be inescapable, inevitable, and indispensable of part of our life.
While rejection is everywhere and it understandably stings, there is no point in trying to avoid it.
Sure,Running away from rejection may offer some temporaray relif,
spending your whole life trying to avoid any interaction that may or may not lead to rejection is
a very limited way of living and a very impoverished understanding and conception of life
You end up hating people, hating life and never stepping out of your comfort zone ever

how absolutely not to deal with it, which is throw a fit, flip a table over and turn into a sore loser
and or an angry Karen.

However, another extreme of dealing with rejuction is a lot more common and it usually flies under the radar, which is to internalize it and let it leave a dent in our self-worth self-esteem
Although these two strategies of dealing with rejection are diametrically opposed to one another, both are eqaully self-destructive and, dare I say, narcissistic.
