Electronic circuits function about a million times faster  than biochemical ones, so machine should think about a million times faster  than the minds that built it.

I find it is very much like "tech explosion" theory in science fiction. What matter isn't whether super AI would be invents but there's literally no time leave us to solve a series of problem caused by super AI once it comes. So a sorts of crisis awareness and actions should not be doubtde as far-fetched
