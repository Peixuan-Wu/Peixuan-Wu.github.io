##  future AI 142 | 220517

Electronic circuits function about a million times faster  than biochemical ones, so machine should think about a million times faster  than the minds that built it.

I find it is very much like "tech explosion" theory in science fiction. What matter isn't whether super AI would be invents but there's literally no time leave us to solve a series of problem caused by super AI once it comes. So a sorts of crisis awareness and actions should not be doubtde as far-fetched

## medical imaging | 220518

medical imaging can help us fight against cancer not blindly but more precisely

Actually, medical imaging is very important for treating tumor and I think it is a sort of application of computer vision. Every single tumor cell is fatal for human body. In the past, when doctor are removing the tumor part of our body piece by piece, they can only distinguish the normal and tumor by pressing the tissue by their thumb. However, with development of medical imaging, PET-CT technology can show doctor where the mass of tumor located. But the difficiency is clear as every single tumore cell can grow up and make bad effect on our body. Human need some medical imaging technology to show every single tumor cell location and doctor can precisely remove them.



Rejection always seems to be inescapable, inevitable, and indispensable of part of our life.
While rejection is everywhere and it understandably stings, there is no point in trying to avoid it.
Sure,Running away from rejection may offer some temporaray relif,
spending your whole life trying to avoid any interaction that may or may not lead to rejection is
a very limited way of living and a very impoverished understanding and conception of life
You end up hating people, hating life and never stepping out of your comfort zone ever

how absolutely not to deal with it, which is throw a fit, flip a table over and turn into a sore loser
and or an angry Karen.

However, another extreme of dealing with rejuction is a lot more common and it usually flies under the radar, which is to internalize it and let it leave a dent in our self-worth self-esteem
Although these two strategies of dealing with rejection are diametrically opposed to one another, both are eqaully self-destructive and, dare I say, narcissistic.

## How much you need to change

insinuate: what are you tring to insinuate is that I have no self-control

throw a fit || had a fit || pitching a fit || breathing fire || spitting feathers || flip a table over

ususally slip under the radar || slip under the my radar || unnoticed || undetected || unconsidered

internalize it || unconscious assimilate some attitudees or behavior to make them part of nature 

leave a dent in our self-worth and self-esteem

sore loser

self-destructive

dare I say 

take it personally

temporary relife

before I get on stage

I could feel tears well

hit-and-run accident

associated sth to sth 

abolish bride price

devasted by death

there were times that when I thought about all the work so many had done and I wondered what had it amounted to

to continue work you had started but could not complete before ddl.

crying urgently for wholesale change against racial injustice, religious and ethnic persecution

catastrophic climate change

The cruel inequality has left us more divided and divisive than ever in my lifetime

 The problems are too interdependent and too entangled


prioritizing the collective we, not individual I


sounds too idealistic

the sectors of society || poor sectors

cut me off  打断说话

straight-talking conversation deepened my moral imagination

sweltering (uncomfotable hot)

what if each of us gave more to the world than we took from it

cynics  
cynical  
believing that people are motivated by self-interest; distrustful of human sincerity or integrity.

And though I've learned the folly of unbridled optimism

victimize
victimied

put sth at the center of our system

holding opposing values in tension
